# Arduino-RFID-access-control-
 RFID based control system design is based on microcontroller control system which by using Arduino UNO that works with ATMEGA328P microchip which is fully suitable for such applications, the RFID module used is MFRC522 RFID module which is a reliable and compatible component to work with Arduino's boards, for door control a 28BJY-48 stepper motor is used that can be controlled in both directions and also number of steps and speed can be controlled, the stepper motor is derived using ULN2003 high voltage, high current Darlington array Integrated circuit. A 16x2 LCD display is used as output component to show different situations of the system, also an electric buzzer or a piezo transducer is used to generate system sounds and alarming in different situations,  a LED is used as indicators also with different situations, and finally a push bottom is used for admin to erase the EEPROM of the microcontroller, the implementation also uses some wires, jumpers, and breadboards for testing the functionality of the system.
